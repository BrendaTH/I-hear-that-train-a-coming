# Train Schedule
### Homework week 7


When adding trains to the schedule board, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination 
* First Train Time -- 24 hour clock
* Frequency -- in minutes

The app should calculate the following items:
* Minutes Away from arrival
* Next arrival time (24 hour clock)

I also added an interval timer that fires once a minute. It updates the table each time it runs
